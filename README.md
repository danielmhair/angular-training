# Angular Training

The purpose of this training is to help anyone understand Angular in-depth so you can really use its power effectively and more efficiently.

If you want to utilize Angular at its fullest, first understand the basics, then the advanced basics.

However, keep in mind that this training is a lot more thorough. It will go into the origins of these, and explain why they are needed in the first place.

## The Basics

First and formost, take time to understand the basics. Angular's new tutorial playground is very helpful.
